📌 Repository Overview

👉 This repository contains my API Automation programs built using Java + Rest Assured.
- These are standalone programs, focused on demonstrating API automation concepts.
- The repo contains collection of modular examples, where each file covers a specific topic (requests, assertions, serialization, schema validation, etc.).





✅ Key Highlights

🔹 Request building with RequestSpecification

🔹 CRUD Operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Rest Assured

🔹 POJO Classes for request & response payloads

🔹 Serialization & Deserialization with Gson

🔹 Different types of Assertions
- Hamcrest Matchers
- TestNG Assertions
- AssertJ Fluent Assertions

🔹 Response data extraction (path, JsonPath, POJO mapping)

🔹 Schema Validation to ensure structure & datatype correctness
